***JavaScript Homework:*** This homework assignment used JavaScript, d3.js, CSS, and HTML to take data (found in [data.js](UFO-level-1/static/js) and append it to a table on the page when a user selects certain filters. The primary assignment ([UFO-level-1](UFO-level-1)) contains a form for the user to discover UFO sightings on a specified date. The bonus assignment ([UFO-level-2](UFO-level-2)) contains extra dropdown buttons to discover UFO sightings by selecting additional options from the filters.

**UFO-level-1:** This folder contains the primary assignment, where the user can filter the table by date only.
